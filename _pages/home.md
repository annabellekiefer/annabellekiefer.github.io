    <h1>Welcome to my E-Portfolio!</h1>
    <p>My name is Annabelle Kiefer and I am a master student in the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master <a href="https://master-cde.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Copernicus Master in Digital Earth.</a>. I am currently studying in my first semester at the <a href="https://www.plus.ac.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris-Lodron-University of Salzburg</a>, Austria, focusing on Earth Observation and Geoinformatics. In my second year I will go to the <a href="https://www.upol.cz/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Palacký University of Olomouc</a>, Czech Republic, to specialize in Geovisualization and Geocommunication.</p>
    <p>I completed my bachelor’s degree in Environmental Geosciences with a focus on Geoinformatics and Remote Sensing at the University of Trier, Germany. In the process, I gained important knowledge in the fields of Remote Sensing, Geoinformatics and Geovisualization, using software such as ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, ERDAS IMAGINE and SNAP. I am currently expanding my knowledge by learning more about Big Earth data processing, spatial database management and web cartography.</p>
